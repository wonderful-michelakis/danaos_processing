```yaml
table:
- group if known.: Assist Master in all communications with the helicopter
- group if known.: Establishes communication with Ship Rescue Team at designated hoisting
    area. There will be a high noise level under the helicopter, making voice communication
    almost impossible. Arrange a set of hand signals among the crew who will assist.
- group if known.: Transfers the patient (with lifejacket) to the hoisting area bearing
    in mind that time is important
- group if known.: Ensures that all team is properly wearing safety equipment, overalls,
    boots, gloves except hats

```

## During Transfer


<!-- Entity: E017 | Type: EntityType.TEXT | Page: 2 -->

If  possible,  move  the  patient  to  a  position  as  close  to  the  hoist  area  as  his  condition  permits  TIME  IS IMPORTANT.


<!-- Entity: E018 | Type: EntityType.TEXT | Page: 2 -->

1Allow  the  hoisting  apparatus  to  contact  some  steel  part  of  the  ship  before  handling  it.  This  will release any static electricity


<!-- Entity: E019 | Type: EntityType.TEXT | Page: 2 -->

2-  A  guide-line  may  be  attached  to  the  apparatus.    Keep  same  clear  from  obstacles.  The  handling  of  this  line (uncharged) is without danger;


<!-- Entity: E020 | Type: EntityType.TEXT | Page: 2 -->

3- Take care that the patient's hands remain inside the stretcher. Let the helicopter's winch-man know when he can start heaving. It is worth noting that a crew man will usually be lowered to the ship's deck to effect the lifting of the stretcher or casualty.  The motion of the hand is Thumb Up


<!-- Entity: E021 | Type: EntityType.TEXT | Page: 2 -->

4- Should it be necessary to unhook the hoisting apparatus; keep the hook clear from the ship and signal-By thumb up-when the cleared hook can be hove in. Never fasten the hook on deck and the stretcher is never to be moved without being unhooked


<!-- Entity: E022 | Type: EntityType.TEXT | Page: 2 -->

5- As soon as the patient has been placed in the stretcher then signal the pilot to slack off the wire, hook on and heave. Prevent the stretcher from swinging during hoisting. Use the guide-line, if any, for stabilising and steering the stretcher. Take care that the line is free from feet and legs of the ship's crew!


<!-- Entity: E023 | Type: EntityType.TEXT | Page: 2 -->

## Hi-Line Technique


<!-- Entity: E024 | Type: EntityType.TEXT | Page: 2 -->

In very bad weather, it may not be possible to lower the stretcher for a crewman and stop directly on to the deck. In such a case, a rope extension of the hoist line may be lowered to the ship.


<!-- Entity: E025 | Type: EntityType.TEXT | Page: 2 -->

This should be handled by a member of the ship's crew and taken in as the helicopter pays out the hoist cable. Coil down the line on deck clear of snags, but do not make it fast. The helicopter will pay out the full scope of wire and descend, probably to one side of the vessel, while the ship's crew continue to take in the slack until the winch hook and strop are on board.


<!-- Entity: E026 | Type: EntityType.TEXT | Page: 2 -->

Whilst taking in the slack, remember that the ship and the helicopter will be moving relative to each other-take great care to keep the line outboard of all obstruction.


<!-- Entity: E027 | Type: EntityType.TEXT | Page: 2 -->

A member of the helicopter crew may or may not be lowered with strop. The casualty will then be secured in the strop and, when he or other member of the ship's crew signifies that he is ready, the helicopter will climb and take in the wire. Pay out the extension rope, keeping enough weight on it to keep it taut; until the end is reached, then cast the end clear of the ship's side; unless further evacuation of crew is intended when, if possible, the end of the line should be retained on board to make recovery of the stop for the next man easier-but do not make the line fast. When large numbers of casualties are to be lifted, two strops may be offered simultaneously; one casualty is to be placed in each strop in the normal manner

The  following  information  is  required  for  Medical  Evacuation.  Master  or  crew  member  in  charge  should  have  this information ready for the radio man from the Coast Guard helicopter.
