A member of the helicopter crew may or may not be lowered with strop. The casualty will then be secured in the strop and, when he or other member of the ship's crew signifies that he is ready, the helicopter will climb and take in the wire. Pay out the extension rope, keeping enough weight on it to keep it taut; until the end is reached, then cast the end clear of the ship's side; unless further evacuation of crew is intended when, if possible, the end of the line should be retained on board to make recovery of the stop for the next man easier-but do not make the line fast. When large numbers of casualties are to be lifted, two strops may be offered simultaneously; one casualty is to be placed in each strop in the normal manner
