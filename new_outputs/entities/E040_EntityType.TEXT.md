Whenever there is an amendment to controlled documents, all obsolete version(s) will be removed  from  areas  of  work  to  prevent  the  unintended  use.    DSMS  documentation (Emergency  Procedures  Manual,  Policy  Manual,  Procedures  Manual,  Fleet  Instructions Manual)  will  be  updated  through  ISM  Administrator  and  a  hard  copy  will  also  remain  on board in Ship Office and Bridge in accordance with Filing System (P21). The SQE Coordinator is also responsible to forward amended Controlled Document to the vessels, accompanied by the DTF, which will be signed by the Master and returned to Head Office (one copy kept on board).  The Master is responsible to remove the obsolete documents from the area of work, keeping them (marked Superseded) in his Superseded Document file.
