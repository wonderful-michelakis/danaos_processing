the Document Transmittal Form (DTF). The DTF will be signed by the Master and returned to the Head Office. A copy of the DTF is kept by the Master on board.

<!-- Entity: E036 | Type: TEXT | Page: 3 -->

## 1.3.3 Reviews & Amendments To Controlled Documents

<!-- Entity: E037 | Type: TEXT | Page: 3 -->

Reviews to controlled documents are approved by the same persons as for their original issue (section 3.1).

<!-- Entity: E038 | Type: TEXT | Page: 3 -->

Necessity of revision derives from Management reviews, any CHANGE REQUEST form issued or Dept. Director requirement for amendments to procedures affecting his Dept. Any amendment is screened for ISM, ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 compliance by the SQE Director and thereafter is forwarded to the Management for approval. Once approval is granted, the SQE coordinator updates ISM administrator with the new revision and distributes as per below distribution list.

<!-- Entity: E039 | Type: TEXT | Page: 3 -->

Procedures shall be revised & issued to the next revision number as a whole document. As far as the rest of the Controlled Documents is concerned, revisions shall be carried out on a section by section basis. Amendments will be in Blue and italics font style.

<!-- Entity: E040 | Type: TEXT | Page: 3 -->

Whenever there is an amendment to controlled documents, all obsolete version(s) will be removed from areas of work to prevent the unintended use. DSMS documentation (Emergency Procedures Manual, Policy Manual, Procedures Manual, Fleet Instructions Manual) will be updated through ISM Administrator and a hard copy will also remain on board in Ship Office and Bridge in accordance with Filing System (P21). The SQE Coordinator is also responsible to forward amended Controlled Document to the vessels, accompanied by the DTF, which will be signed by the Master and returned to Head Office (one copy kept on board). The Master is responsible to remove the obsolete documents from the area of work, keeping them (marked Superseded) in his Superseded Document file.

<!-- Entity: E041 | Type: TEXT | Page: 3 -->

Controlled documents are kept within Company ISM administrator and updated through this system. For reference purposes, through the Administrator tools, the list of updated versions are printed and sent onboard, originally, and thereafter whenever there is a change of documentation involved.

<!-- Entity: E042 | Type: TEXT | Page: 3 -->

## 1.3.4 Reference Publication

<!-- Entity: E043 | Type: TEXT | Page: 3 -->

In support of Controlled Documents, the Company supplies reference publication (e.g. SOLAS, MARPOL, STCW, etc.) in their latest edition for the instruction and guidance of Masters, Officers, crew and shore based staff. Such documents are kept in the Head Office library and in a library established on board each vessel. A register of such reference documentation is kept, indicating also their latest edition.

<!-- Entity: E044 | Type: TEXT | Page: 3 -->

Documents included in the vessels and office library are listed in the 'Library List'.

<!-- Entity: E045 | Type: TEXT | Page: 3 -->

The SQE Coordinator is responsible to ensure that all reference publications are updated to the latest edition ashore and Operations Dept. is responsible for updating the vessel 'Library List'.

<!-- Entity: E046 | Type: TEXT | Page: 3 -->

The Master is responsible to ensure that the on board Library List is kept updated at all times and keeps Danaos Ops advised in case of any requirement.
